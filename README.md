# DSS_Gymnasium
DSS_Gymnasium is a project hub for developing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and DeepRL environments using OpenDSS and Gymnasium for electric power distribution systems research.
This repository is built to provide a standardized framework for building customized learning environments for traditional optimization and control problems which may be converted 
into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and can be solved using model-free RL/DeepRL algorithms.  This toolkit is built for researchers of all expertise working in RL and power systems,
and is built on foundational research in power systems at Washington State University in the SCALE Lab (Sustainable Climate-resilient Analytics for Large-scale Energy Systems) research group under Dr. Anamika Dubey.
